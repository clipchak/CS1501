# CS1501
Projects coded in Java for Pitt's CS1501 Algorithm Implementation class


**Project 1 - design an algorithm that finds the best strategy for cutting an X by Y piece of cloth
so that the products made from the resulting pieces give the maximum sum of selling prices (dynamic programming)**

**Project 2 - implement a hastable and write a program that unscrambles anagrams**

**Project 3 - implement Prim's algorithm and the MST-walk algorithm to approximately solve the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem**

**Project 4 - find the Longest Common Subsequence of two strings using dynamic programming**

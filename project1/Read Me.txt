INSTALLATION

The following files should be present:

     TestDriver.java
     Pattern.java
     
I created and changed these files and included them but was not able to use them to produce graphics:
	Cloth.java
	ClothCutter.java
	Cut.java
	TestClothCutter.java
	TestGraphicsExample.java
	Garment.java
	Pattern.java

USAGE

Run the TestDriver program. Change the patterns with different widths, heights, values.
The program will calculate and print out the optimal value from the set of patterns
and maximum height and width using a bottom-up iterative method.

Ex: 
    ArrayList<Pattern> patterns = new ArrayList<Pattern>() ;
    patterns.add(new Pattern(2,2,1,"A")) ;
    patterns.add(new Pattern(2,6,4,"B")) ;
    patterns.add(new Pattern(4,2,3,"C")) ;
    patterns.add(new Pattern(5,3,5,"D")) ;
    int width = 40 ;
    int height = 25 ;
    int pixels = 30 ;
    initializeMemo(width,height,patterns);
    System.out.println("Value of optimal layout: " + optimal(memo.length,memo[0].length,patterns));

Produces 
"Value of optimal layout: 370"


PROBLEMS

No graphics
